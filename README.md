   - Build and refine projects like *Portfolio Website*, *To-Do App*, and *Spotify Clone*.  

2. **🐍 Python / AI-ML:**  
   - Start exploring Python more deeply for small AI/ML-based experiments.  

3. **💻 C Language:**  
   - Complete pending updates for *Expense Tracker* and *Number Guessing Game* (file handling & improvements).

## 🎯 Learning Goals

- Strengthen fundamentals through hands-on projects.  
- Transition fully into **Web Development** and **Python-based learning**.  
- **No new C projects** — focus only on finishing the existing two to completion.
