## ðŸ§  Project List

| Project Name | Description | Status |
|---------------|-------------|--------|
| ðŸŽ¯ Number Guessing Game | My first ever project in C! A simple number guessing game built using loops, conditionals, and random number generation. | âœ… Completed (Can be Improved) |
| ðŸ’° Expense Tracker | A terminal-based expense management app. It allows adding, viewing, and removing expense categories directly in the console. File handling system not yet added. | ðŸš§ Under Development |

## ðŸ“ˆ Learnings from This Section
- Strengthened understanding of **loops**, **arrays**, and **conditional statements**.  
- Learned how to build **menu-driven programs** in the terminal.  
- Improved problem-solving and logical thinking in C.

## ðŸ§© Future Plans
This section might not expand much further, but it marks the foundation of my programming journey â€” moving toward **C++ (DSA)** and **Web Development**.
